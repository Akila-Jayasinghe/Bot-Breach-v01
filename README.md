https://via.placeholder.com/800x200/2D2D2D/FFFFFF?text=Bot+Breach+-+2D+Stealth+%2526+Strategy (Note: Replace with an actual banner image)

Bot Breach is a 2D top-down stealth-puzzle game where you command a swarm of upgradeable micro-drones to infiltrate a high-security corporate office. Plan your route, avoid detection, and hack the system—all without ever setting foot inside.

🎮 Game Concept
You are a master thief attempting to pull off the ultimate digital heist. Your tools? A fleet of small, nimble robots disguised as cleaning bots. Your mission: remotely navigate through laser grids, security drones, and complex traps to reach the central server and extract valuable data.
  Genre: Stealth, Strategy, Puzzle
  Perspective: 2D Top-Down
  Core Experience: Tense, tactical gameplay focused on indirect control, environmental analysis, and upgrading your bots to overcome new challenges.

✨ Key Features
  Remote Infiltration: Control your bots from a remote location. Your physical presence is never in the game world.
  Environmental Puzzles: Each level is a unique puzzle filled with dynamic hazards like patrolling drones that require careful observation and timing to bypass.
  Clean Aesthetic: A semi-futuristic office environment rendered in a clean 2D pixel-art style, with atmospheric lighting and sound design.
