**Bot Breach** is a 2D top-down stealth-puzzle game where you command a swarm of upgradeable micro-drones to infiltrate a high-security corporate office. Plan your route, avoid detection, and hack the system—all without ever setting foot inside.

## 🎮 Game Concept

You are a master thief attempting to pull off the ultimate digital heist. Your tools? A fleet of small, nimble robots disguised as cleaning bots. Your mission: remotely navigate through laser grids, security drones, and complex traps to reach the central server and extract valuable data.

*   **Genre:** Stealth, Strategy, Puzzle
*   **Perspective:** 2D Top-Down
*   **Core Experience:** Tense, tactical gameplay focused on indirect control, environmental analysis, and upgrading your bots to overcome new challenges.

## ✨ Key Features

*   **Remote Infiltration:** Control your bots from a remote location. Your physical presence is never in the game world.
*   **Evolving Bots:** Upgrade your drones with new abilities like EMP bursts, signal jammers, dash moves, and wall-climbing to adapt to increasingly complex security measures.
*   **Environmental Puzzles:** Each level is a unique puzzle filled with dynamic hazards like moving lasers, pressure plates, and surveillance cameras that require careful observation and timing to bypass.
*   **Clean Aesthetic:** A semi-futuristic office environment rendered in a clean 2D pixel-art style, with atmospheric lighting and sound design.
